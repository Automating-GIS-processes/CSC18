Geometric Objects - Spatial Data Model
======================================

**Sources:**

These materials are partly based on `Shapely
-documentation <https://shapely.readthedocs.io>`__ and `Westra

3 <https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/python-geospatial-development-second-edition>`__.

Overview of geometric objects and Shapely -module
-------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: http://www.helsinki.fi/science/accessibility/maintenance/Kuvia/SpatialDataModel.PNG

*Fundamental geometric objects that can be used in Python with*
`Shapely <https://shapely.readthedocs.io>`_ *module*

The most fundamental geometric objects are **Points**, **Lines** and
**Polygons** which are the basic ingredients when working with spatial
data in vector format. Python has a specific module called
`Shapely <https://shapely.readthedocs.io>`__ that can be
used to create and work with *Geometric Objects*. There are many useful
functionalities that you can do with Shapely such as:

-  Create a **Line** or **Polygon** from a *Collection* of
   **Point** geometries
-  Calculate areas/length/bounds etc. of input geometries
-  Make geometric operations based on the input geometries such as
   **Union**, **Difference**, **Distance** etc.
-  Make spatial queries between geometries such **Intersects**,
   **Touches**, **Crosses**, **Within** etc.

**Geometric Objects consist of coordinate tuples where:**

-  **Point** -object represents a single point in space. Points can be
   either two-dimensional (x, y) or three dimensional (x, y, z).
-  **LineString** -object (i.e. a line) represents a sequence of points
   joined together to form a line. Hence, a line consist of a list of at
   least two coordinate tuples
-  **Polygon** -object represents a filled area that consists of a list
   of at least three coordinate tuples that forms the outerior ring and
   a (possible) list of hole polygons.

**It is also possible to have a collection of geometric objects (e.g.
Polygons with multiple parts):**

-  **MultiPoint** -object represents a collection of points and consists
   of a list of coordinate-tuples
-  **MultiLineString** -object represents a collection of lines and
   consists of a list of line-like sequences
-  **MultiPolygon** -object represents a collection of polygons that
   consists of a list of polygon-like sequences that construct from
   exterior ring and (possible) hole list tuples

Point
-----

-  Creating point is easy, you pass x and y coordinates into Point()
   -object (+ possibly also z -coordinate) :

.. ipython:: python

     # Import necessary geometric objects from shapely module
     from shapely.geometry import Point, LineString, Polygon

     # Create Point geometric object(s) with coordinates
     point1 = Point(2.2, 4.2)
     point2 = Point(7.2, -25.1)
     point3 = Point(9.26, -2.456)
     point3D = Point(9.26, -2.456, 0.57)
     
     # What is the type of the point?
     point_type = type(point1)

-  Let's see what the variables look like

.. ipython:: python

     print(point1)
     print(point3D)
     print(type(point1))

We can see that the type of the point is shapely's Point which is
represented in a specific format that is based on
`GEOS <https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/>`__ C++ library that is one of the
standard libraries in GIS. It runs under the hood e.g. in `Quantum
GIS <http://www.qgis.org/en/site/>`__. 3D-point can be recognized from
the capital Z -letter in front of the coordinates.

Point attributes and functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Point -object has some built-in attributes that can be accessed and also
some useful functionalities. One of the most useful ones are the ability
to extract the coordinates of a Point and calculate the Euclidian
distance between points.

-  Extracting the coordinates of a Point can be done in a couple of
   different ways

.. ipython:: python

     # Get the coordinates
     point_coords = point1.coords

     # What is the type of this?
     type(point_coords)

Ok, we can see that the output is a Shapely CoordinateSequence. Let's
see how we can get out the actual coordinates:

.. ipython:: python

     # Get x and y coordinates
     xy = point_coords.xy

     # Get only x coordinates of Point1
     x = point1.x

     # Whatabout y coordinate?
     y = point1.y

-  What is inside?

.. ipython:: python

     print(xy)
     print(x)
     print(y)

Okey, so we can see that the our xy variable contains a tuple where x and y are stored inside of a numpy arrays.
However, our x and y variables are plain decimal numbers.

-  It is also possible to calculate the distance between points which
   can be useful in many applications
-  the returned distance is based on the projection of the points
   (degrees in WGS84, meters in UTM)

.. ipython:: python

     # Calculate the distance between point1 and point2
     point_dist = point1.distance(point2)
     
     print("Distance between the points is {0:.2f} decimal degrees".format(point_dist))

LineString
----------

-  Creating a LineString -object is fairly similar to how Point is
   created. Now instead using a single coordinate-tuple we can construct
   the line using either a list of shapely Point -objects or pass
   coordinate-tuples:

.. ipython:: python

     # Create a LineString from our Point objects
     line = LineString([point1, point2, point3])

     # It is also possible to use coordinate tuples having the same outcome
     line2 = LineString([(2.2, 4.2), (7.2, -25.1), (9.26, -2.456)])


- Let's see how our LineString looks like

.. ipython:: python

     print(line)
     print(line2)
     type(line)

Ok, now we can see that variable line constitutes of multiple
coordinate-pairs and the type of the data is shapely LineString.

LineString attributes and functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LineString -object has many useful built-in attributes and
functionalities. It is for instance possible to extract the coordinates
or the length of a LineString (line), calculate the centroid of the
line, create points along the line at specific distance, calculate the
closest distance from a line to specified Point and simplify the
geometry. See full list of functionalities from `Shapely
documentation <http://toblerity.org/shapely/manual.html#>`__. Here, we
go through a few of them.

-  We can extract the coordinates of a LineString similarly as with
   Point

.. ipython:: python

     # Get x and y coordinates of the line
     lxy = line.xy
     
     print(lxy)

Okey, we can see that the coordinates are again stored as a numpy arrays
where first array includes all x-coordinates and the second all the
y-coordinates respectively.

-  We can extract only x or y coordinates by referring to those arrays
   as follows

.. ipython:: python

     # Extract x coordinates
     line_x = lxy[0]

     # Extract y coordinates straight from the LineObject by referring to a array at index 1
     line_y = line.xy[1]

     print(line_x)

     print(line_y)

-  We can get specific attributes such as lenght of the line and center
   of the line (centroid) straight from the LineString object itself

.. ipython:: python

     # Get the lenght of the line
     l_length = line.length

     # Get the centroid of the line
     l_centroid = line.centroid
     
     # What type is the centroid?
     centroid_type = type(l_centroid)

     # Print the outputs
     print("Length of our line: {0:.2f}".format(l_length))
     print("Centroid of our line: ", l_centroid)
     print("Type of the centroid:", centroid_type)

Okey, so these are already fairly useful information for many different
GIS tasks, and we didn't even calculate anything yet! These attributes
are built-in in every LineString object that is created. Notice that the
centroid that is returned is Point -object that has its own functions as
was described earlier.

Polygon
-------

-  Creating a Polygon -object continues the same logic of how Point and
   LineString were created but Polygon object only accepts
   coordinate-tuples as input. Polygon needs at least three
   coordinate-tuples:

.. ipython:: python

     # Create a Polygon from the coordinates
     poly = Polygon([(2.2, 4.2), (7.2, -25.1), (9.26, -2.456)])

     # We can also use our previously created Point objects (same outcome)
     # --> notice that Polygon object requires x,y coordinates as input
     poly2 = Polygon([[p.x, p.y] for p in [point1, point2, point3]])
     
     # Geometry type can be accessed as a String
     poly_type = poly.geom_type
      
     # Using the Python's type function gives the type in a different format
     poly_type2 = type(poly)

     # Let's see how our Polygon looks like
     print(poly)
     print(poly2)
     print("Geometry type as text:", poly_type)
     print("Geometry how Python shows it:", poly_type2)

Notice that Polygon has double parentheses around the coordinates. This
is because Polygon can also have holes inside of it. As the help of
Polygon -object tells, a Polygon can be constructed using exterior
coordinates and interior coordinates (optional) where the interior
coordinates creates a hole inside the Polygon:

.. code:: python

     Help on Polygon in module shapely.geometry.polygon object:
     class Polygon(shapely.geometry.base.BaseGeometry)
      |  A two-dimensional figure bounded by a linear ring
      |
      |  A polygon has a non-zero area. It may have one or more negative-space
      |  "holes" which are also bounded by linear rings. If any rings cross each
      |  other, the feature is invalid and operations on it may fail.
      |
      |  Attributes
      |  ----------
      |  exterior : LinearRing
      |      The ring which bounds the positive space of the polygon.
      |  interiors : sequence
      |      A sequence of rings which bound all existing holes.

-  Let's create a Polygon with a hole inside

.. ipython:: python

     # Let's create a bounding box of the world and make a whole in it

     # First we define our exterior
     world_exterior = [(-180, 90), (-180, -90), (180, -90), (180, 90)]

     # Let's create a single big hole where we leave ten decimal degrees at the boundaries of the world
     # Notice: there could be multiple holes, thus we need to provide a list of holes
     hole = [[(-170, 80), (-170, -80), (170, -80), (170, 80)]]

     # World without a hole
     world = Polygon(shell=world_exterior)

     # Now we can construct our Polygon with the hole inside
     world_has_a_hole = Polygon(shell=world_exterior, holes=hole)

-  Let's see what we have now:

.. ipython:: python

     print(world)
     print(world_has_a_hole)
     type(world_has_a_hole)

Now we can see that the polygon has two different tuples of coordinates.
The first one represents the outerior and the second one represents the
hole inside of the Polygon.

Polygon attributes and functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  We can again access different attributes that are really useful such
   as area, centroid, bounding box, exterior, and exterior-length of the
   Polygon

.. ipython:: python

     # Get the centroid of the Polygon
     world_centroid = world.centroid

     # Get the area of the Polygon
     world_area = world.area

     # Get the bounds of the Polygon (i.e. bounding box)
     world_bbox = world.bounds

     # Get the exterior of the Polygon
     world_ext = world.exterior

     # Get the length of the exterior
     world_ext_length = world_ext.length

-  Let's see what we have now

.. ipython:: python

     print("Poly centroid: ", world_centroid)
     print("Poly Area: ", world_area)
     print("Poly Bounding Box: ", world_bbox)
     print("Poly Exterior: ", world_ext)
     print("Poly Exterior Length: ", world_ext_length)

Geometry collections (optional)
-------------------------------

.. note::

    This part is not obligatory but it contains some useful information
    related to construction and usage of geometry collections and some
    special geometric objects -such as bounding box.

In some occassions it is useful to store e.g. multiple lines or polygons
under a single feature (i.e. a single row in a Shapefile represents more
than one line or polygon object). Collections of points are implemented
by using a MultiPoint -object, collections of curves by using a
MultiLineString -object, and collections of surfaces by a MultiPolygon
-object. These collections are not computationally significant, but are
useful for modeling certain kinds of features. A Y-shaped line feature
(such as road), or multiple polygons (e.g. islands on a like), can be
presented nicely as a whole by a using MultiLineString or MultiPolygon
accordingly. Creating and visualizing a minimum `bounding
box <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_box>`__ e.g. around
your data points is a really useful function for many purposes (e.g.
trying to understand the extent of your data), here we demonstrate how
to create one using Shapely.

-  Geometry collections can be constructed in a following manner:

.. ipython:: python

     # Import collections of geometric objects + bounding box
     from shapely.geometry import MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, box

     # Create a MultiPoint object of our points 1,2 and 3
     multi_point = MultiPoint([point1, point2, point3])

     # It is also possible to pass coordinate tuples inside
     multi_point2 = MultiPoint([(2.2, 4.2), (7.2, -25.1), (9.26, -2.456)])

     # We can also create a MultiLineString with two lines
     line1 = LineString([point1, point2])
     line2 = LineString([point2, point3])
     multi_line = MultiLineString([line1, line2])

     # MultiPolygon can be done in a similar manner
     # Let's divide our world into western and eastern hemispheres with a hole on the western hemisphere
     # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     # Let's create the exterior of the western part of the world
     west_exterior = [(-180, 90), (-180, -90), (0, -90), (0, 90)]

     # Let's create a hole --> remember there can be multiple holes, thus we need to have a list of hole(s). 
     # Here we have just one.
     west_hole = [[(-170, 80), (-170, -80), (-10, -80), (-10, 80)]]

     # Create the Polygon
     west_poly = Polygon(shell=west_exterior, holes=west_hole)

     # Let's create the Polygon of our Eastern hemisphere polygon using bounding box
     # For bounding box we need to specify the lower-left corner coordinates and upper-right coordinates
     min_x, min_y = 0, -90
     max_x, max_y = 180, 90

     # Create the polygon using box() function
     east_poly_box = box(minx=min_x, miny=min_y, maxx=max_x, maxy=max_y)

     # Let's create our MultiPolygon. We can pass multiple Polygon -objects into our MultiPolygon as a list
     multi_poly = MultiPolygon([west_poly, east_poly_box])

- Let's see what do we have:
     
.. ipython:: python

     print("MultiPoint:", multi_point)
     print("MultiLine: ", multi_line)
     print("Bounding box: ", east_poly_box)
     print("MultiPoly: ", multi_poly)

We can see that the outputs are similar to the basic geometric objects
that we created previously but now these objects contain multiple
features of those points, lines or polygons.

Geometry collection -objects' attributes and functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  We can also get many useful attributes from those objects:

.. ipython:: python

     # Convex Hull of our MultiPoint --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull
     convex = multi_point.convex_hull

     # How many lines do we have inside our MultiLineString?
     lines_count = len(multi_line)

     # Let's calculate the area of our MultiPolygon
     multi_poly_area = multi_poly.area

     # We can also access different items inside our geometry collections. We can e.g. access a single polygon from
     # our MultiPolygon -object by referring to the index

     # Let's calculate the area of our Western hemisphere (with a hole) which is at index 0
     west_area = multi_poly[0].area

     # We can check if we have a "valid" MultiPolygon. MultiPolygon is thought as valid if the individual polygons 
     # does notintersect with each other. Here, because the polygons have a common 0-meridian, we should NOT have 
     # a valid polygon. This can be really useful information when trying to find topological errors from your data
     valid = multi_poly.is_valid

-  Let's see what do we have:

.. ipython:: python

     print("Convex hull of the points: ", convex)
     print("Number of lines in MultiLineString:", lines_count)
     print("Area of our MultiPolygon:", multi_poly_area)
     print("Area of our Western Hemisphere polygon:", west_area)
     print("Is polygon valid?: ", valid)

From the above we can see that MultiPolygons have exactly the same
attributes available as single geometric objects but now the information
such as area calculates the area of ALL of the individual -objects
combined. There are also some extra features available such as
*is\_valid* attribute that tells if the polygons or lines intersect with
each other.
